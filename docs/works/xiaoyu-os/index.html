<p><em>XiaoYu OS</em> is a brand new operating system built for the modern engineer&rsquo;s daily
workflow.
Every application runs in secure, isolated environement with minimal privileges,
requesting permissions only when needed. This also ensures a pristine system, even after
years of use, free from accumulated clutter or hidden processes.
XiaoYu OS empowers developers to directly maintain their applications, eliminating the
need for dedicated package maintainers.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-_xiaoyu-os_-unique">What makes <em>XiaoYu OS</em> unique?</h2>
<p>The <em>XiaoYu OS</em> is the result of the author&rsquo;s long-term thinking about operating system and human-computer interaction. It is a completely new design, from its visual appearance to its internal workings. The system includes many innovative features that make it unique.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Strict security</strong></p>
<p>Except for a few programs such as the system initializer, graphic compositor and message bus, all applications run in their own containers. Applications are granted minimal permissions, so you can run any application without worrying about it modifying your system or accessing your private data and files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean and tidy</strong></p>
<p>Temporary data and files generated by applications are limited to their own containers. When an application is removed, all associated cache and temporary files are automatically removed, ensuring no garbage is left in the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>High availability</strong></p>
<p>The system avoids the use of global dynamic shared libraries. Instead, each application bundles its own required libraries and resources, ensuring uninterrupted operation even in the face of major system updates or modifications.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<figure class="wide white"><img src="./images/system-arch.webp"
         alt="An overview of the system architecture"/><figcaption>
            <p>An overview of the system architecture</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<blockquote>
<p>To minimize file redundancy, commonly used shared libraries are packaged into a component called &ldquo;Core.&rdquo; A system can simultaneously support multiple versions of &ldquo;Core,&rdquo; while each application can only depend on a specific version. This approach achieves a balance between reducing application size and avoiding shared libraries version compatibility and conflict issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>High portability</strong></p>
<p>Unlike traditional applications that require installation and often system modifications, <em>XiaoYu OS</em> applications are entirely portable. Simply copy the application to your system and run it immediately. Even the copying step can be bypassed; a URL representing the application suffices, and the system will automatically download and cache the necessary code and data from the internet. <em>XiaoYu OS</em> revolutionizes not only the user experience of obtaining applications but also the developer workflow for application distribution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Even <em>XiaoYu OS</em> itself does not require installation. Booting <em>XiaoYu OS</em> is as simple as copying its image to a USB Flash Disk.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Brand new UI</strong></p>
<p><em>XiaoYu OS</em> has a brilliant, dynamic UI that prioritizes efficiency. The new UI steers clear of the shortcomings of traditional UIs, such as rigidity, monotony, and operational inconvenience. It offers a user-friendly and flexible experience that is visually appealing and consistently refreshing. (For details, please refer to the following chapters.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>New interaction mode</strong></p>
<p><em>XiaoYu OS</em> introduces a new approach to human-computer interaction called <em>XiaoYu Terminal</em>, which integrating CLI, GUI, dataset workbench and large language model (LLM) assistance. <em>XiaoYu Terminal</em> empowers advanced users and engineers with an exceptionally flexible and efficient work environment. (For details, please refer to the following chapters)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Seamless Linux application compatibility</strong></p>
<p><em>XiaoYu OS</em> provides a Linux compatibility layer, which allows traditional Linux applications (including CLI programs and GUI applications) to run seamlessly with near-zero performance loss. As a result, <em>XiaoYu OS</em> boasts a large number of high-quality, mature and professional application from the very outset.</p>

<p>TODO</p>
<h2 id="q--a">Q &amp; A</h2>
<p><strong>Is <em>XiaoYu OS</em> a toy operating system?</strong></p>
<p>No, <em>XiaoYu OS</em> is not designed for educational purposes or as a hobby project. It aims to be fully functional operating system for daily use.</p>
<p><strong>Is <em>XiaoYu OS</em> a Linux distribution?</strong></p>
<p>No, <em>XiaoYu OS</em> is not a Linux distribution in the traditional sense. While it is based on the Linux kernel for hardware compatibility, all user-space programs are developed from scratch using <em>XiaoXuan Native</em>, <em>XiaoXuan Core</em>, and <em>Rust</em>. This means that <em>XiaoYu OS</em> does not include common Linux software packages such as <em>Glibc</em>, <em>Systemd</em>, <em>Coreutils</em>, <em>Binutils</em>, and <em>GCC</em>, nor does it have package managers like <em>APT</em>, <em>RPM</em>, <em>DNF</em>, or <em>Pacman</em>. As a result, regular Linux programs cannot run directly on <em>XiaoYu OS</em>.</p>
<p>However, <em>XiaoYu OS</em> includes a built-in &ldquo;Linux compatibility layer&rdquo; that allows most Linux applications to run seamlessly. You can also create <em>Arch</em>, <em>Ubuntu</em>, and <em>Fedora</em>-like Linux environments within <em>XiaoYu OS</em>, allowing you to add or remove applications using familiar methods. This is similar to WSL in Windows and Linux in ChromeOS, but with significant improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Why not make <em>XiaoYu OS</em> a Linux distribution?</strong></p>
<p>There are already many excellent and mature Liunx distributions available, such as <em>Arch</em>, <em>Ubuntu</em>, <em>Debian</em>, and <em>Fedora</em>. I believe there is no need to create &ldquo;yet another Linux distribution&rdquo;. Additionaly, maintaining a distribution&rsquo;s software repository requires a significant amount of effort, which is beyond my personal capabilities. I am more passionate about creating a new operating system that can attract both application developers and users while reducing the burden on system developers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the Linux world offers a vast collection of libraries and programs, it also carries a significant historical burden. These legacy issues can complicate simple tasks and discourage new developers and users. <em>XiaoYu OS</em>, drawing lessons from these challenges, aims to liberate system developers, application developers, and users from these burdens by providing a completely new environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How does <em>XiaoYu OS</em> differ from &ldquo;Immutable Linux&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p><em>XiaoYu OS</em> and &ldquo;Immutable Linux&rdquo; share a similar architecture, but <em>XiaoYu OS</em> provides a completely new runtime environment, including libraries, tools, and languages.</p>
<p><strong>Which desktop environment does <em>XiaoYu OS</em> use?</strong></p>
<p><em>XiaoYu OS</em> uses a custom desktop environemnt developed by me. It has its own unique look and feel, following its own UI design guidelines, and offers a more intuitive user experience.</p>
<p>The desktop environment (graphic server) is based on the Wayland display server protocal, so traditional Linux GUI programs can still run on <em>XiaoYu OS</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Can you briefly describe the system architecture of <em>XiaoYu OS</em>?</strong></p>
<p>The system architecture of <em>XiaoYu OS</em> is very simple and straightforward. It consists of four layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Base System</li>
<li>Core/Runtime (providing common libraries, GUI libraries, etc.)</li>
<li>Containers</li>
<li>Applications</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How do Linux applications run on <em>XiaoYu OS</em>?</strong></p>
<p><em>XiaoYu OS</em> has a lightweight &ldquo;Linux Compatibility layer&rdquo; that create a classic Linux file hierarchy structure, maps the user directory, and launches Linux applications through containers. From the perspective of the Linux application, it is running on a regular Linux system.</p>
<p><strong>Can all Linux applications run normally on <em>XiaoYu OS</em>?</strong></p>
<p>Almost all Linux applications can run on <em>XiaoYu OS</em>, except for those that modify the system or hardware. Some system programs may run but not produce correct results. For example, a program that displays network interface IP addresses will show a virtual IP address instead of the host&rsquo;s real address.</p>
<p><strong>Can <em>XiaoYu OS</em> native applications communicate with Linux applications?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, they can. For example, you can use <em>XiaoYu Terminal</em> to edit a text file by calling <em>Vim</em>. You will need to &ldquo;install&rdquo; a pre-packaged version of <em>Vim</em> using <em>XiaoYu OS</em>&rsquo;s application manager.</p>
<p><strong>Can you show me the disk partition layout of <em>XiaoYu OS</em>?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, here is a typical <em>XiaoYu OS</em> disk parition layout. Users can customize the layout according to their needs.</p>
<p>TODO::</p>
<p><strong>What is &ldquo;Base System B&rdquo;?</strong></p>
<p><em>XiaoYu OS</em>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Base System&rdquo; is a tiny, immutable, atomically updated base system. It contains the Linux kernel, system initializer, message bus, and other basic programs. The base system is read-only. To update the base system, you can only update from &ldquo;Base System A&rdquo; to &ldquo;Base System B&rdquo; (or vice versa). When the update is complete, the system bootloader will choose the newer version from partitions A and B when the machine boots next. The A/B system ensures that the system can always boot correctly and will not be damaged due to a half-completed update.</p>
