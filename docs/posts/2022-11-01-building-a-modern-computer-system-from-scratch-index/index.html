    <p>This is the index for the series of articles <em>Making your own tools and building modern computer system from scratch, step by step</em>.</p>
<p>In the previous article <a href="../2022-10-31-building-a-modern-computer-system-from-scratch-step-by-step">Introduction</a>, it was mentioned that this series consist of four sub-series, each containing several parts. The following are the titles of each part and links to the completed articles. This index will also be updated with new articles.</p>
<p>The first series covers fundamental knowledge, which may not be as exciting as the other three series. but it&rsquo;s recommended not to skip. The field of modern computer technology is vast and complex, with various frameworks and tools constantly emerging. The iteration speed is so fast that it can easily overwhelm us. However, if you study towards the underlying technology, you will find that things become simple and straightforward. After reaching the destination, looking back at the fancy surface technology will become clear and simple. The first series will give you an accurate understanding of system technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe you have seen the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal">fractal graphics</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot set</a>, which can be infinitely zoomed in and moved and always produce a variety of beautiful patterns. You can browse it like exploring the galaxies of our universe, and even spending a whole day on it will not be boring. But it&rsquo;s unbelievable that this vast and complex universe is generated by a simple mathematical function: \(y = x^2 + z\), just keep substituing the value of \(y\) into \(x\), and the big bang happens.</p>

<h2 id="series-1-dive-into-risc-v-system-step-by-step">Series 1: Dive into RISC-V system, step by step</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Part I: Understanding the usage of compiler, linker, debugger and some common binary tools, understanding the organization of program, building minimal freestanding (also called <em>bare metal programs</em>) executable programs.</p>
<ul>
