                <p><em>XiaoXuan Language</em> is an elegant, full-stack programming language.
                    It consists of several variants and can be used to develop a variety applications,
                    including digital circuits and chips,
                    microcontroller programs, GPU shaders, native programs, system programs,
                    service programs, web applications and more.
                    All variants use the same syntax and design philosophy, allowing you to learn
                    one language for all domains of development.

                <p>The <em>XiaoXuan programming language</em> supports writing code in local languages,
                    such as Chinese, Japanese and French. In addition to keywords, the standard library add
                    related documentation are also translated into local languages.
                    Using local language programming is beneficial for children, beginners and
                    non-computer majors who are not native English speakers.
