_XiaoXuan Native_ is a memory-safe, general-purpose programming language inspired by Rust but much simpler. It provides automatic memory management without garbage collection, and avoids complex concepts such as ownership, borrow checking, and lifetimes. It supports compiling to native code for architectures such as _x86-64_, _aarch64_ and _riscv64_.
