_XiaoXuan Native_ is a memory-safe, general-purpose programming language inspired by Rust. It is designed to be simpler than Rust while it still provides automatic memory management without garbage collection, and avoids complex concepts such as ownership, borrow checking, and lifetimes. It aims to replace Rust in certain non-critical scenarios. It currently supports compiling to native code for architectures such as _x86-64_, _aarch64_ and _riscv64_.

> Currently, _XiaoXuan Native_ is written in Rust, but it will be self-hosted in the future ðŸ˜„
