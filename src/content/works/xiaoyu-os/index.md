_XiaoYu OS_ is a brand new operating system built for the modern engineer's daily
workflow.
Every application runs in secure, isolated environement with minimal privileges,
requesting permissions only when needed. This also ensures a pristine system, even after
years of use, free from accumulated clutter or hidden processes.
XiaoYu OS empowers developers to directly maintain their applications, eliminating the
need for dedicated package maintainers.

## What makes _XiaoYu OS_ unique?

The _XiaoYu OS_ is the result of the author's long-term thinking about operating system and human-computer interaction. It is a completely new design, from its visual appearance to its internal workings. The system includes many innovative features that make it unique.

- **Strict security**

  Except for a few programs such as the system initializer, graphic compositor and message bus, all applications run in their own containers. Applications are granted minimal permissions, so you can run any application without worrying about it modifying your system or accessing your private data and files.

- **Clean and tidy**

  Temporary data and files generated by applications are limited to their own containers. When an application is removed, all associated cache and temporary files are automatically removed, ensuring no garbage is left in the system.

- **High availability**

  The system avoids the use of global dynamic shared libraries. Instead, each application bundles its own required libraries and resources, ensuring uninterrupted operation even in the face of major system updates or modifications.

  To minimize file redundancy, commonly used shared libraries are packaged into a component called "Core." A system can simultaneously support multiple versions of "Core," while each application can only depend on a specific version. This approach achieves a balance between reducing application size and avoiding version compatibility and conflict issues with shared libraries.

- **High portability**

  Unlike traditional applications that require installation and often system modifications, _XiaoYu OS_ applications are entirely portable. Simply copy the application to your system and run it immediately. Even the copying step can be bypassed; a URL representing the application suffices, and the system will automatically download and cache the necessary code and data from the internet. _XiaoYu OS_ revolutionizes not only the user experience of launching applications but also the developer workflow for application distribution.

> Even _XiaoYu OS_ itself does not require installation. Booting xyOS is as simple as copying its image to a USB Flash Disk.

- **Brand new UI**

  _XiaoYu OS_ has a brilliant, dynamic UI that prioritizes efficiency. The new UI steers clear of the shortcomings of traditional UIs, such as rigidity, monotony, and operational inconvenience. It offers a user-friendly and flexible experience that is visually appealing and consistently refreshing. (For details, please refer to the following chapters.)

- **New interaction mode**

  _XiaoYu OS_ introduces a new approach to human-computer interaction called _XiaoYu Terminal_, which integrating CLI, GUI, dataset workbench and large language model (LLM) assistance. _XiaoYu Terminal_ empowers advanced users and engineers with an exceptionally flexible and efficient work environment. (For details, please refer to the following chapters)

- **Seamless Linux application compatibility**

  While _XiaoYu OS_ is base on Linux kernel, all system programs and foundational applications are newly built with _XiaoXuan Native_ and _XiaoXuan Core_. In addition, _XiaoYu OS_ discards many outdated Linux features while incorporating more modern ones, so _XiaoYu OS_ is not a Linux distribution.

  Nevertheless, _XiaoYu OS_ provides a Linux compatibility layer, which allows traditional Linux applications (including CLI programs) to run seamlessly with near-zero performance loss. As a result, _XiaoYu OS_ boasts a large number of high-quality, mature and professional application from the very outset.

> _XiaoYu OS_ also supports [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/), you can still use the familiar way to add or remove applications for the system.
