_XiaoXuan Managed_ is used for building secure, robust, low-latency and responsive cloud-native applications (such as microservices and serverless functions etc.), business systems, data science programs, A.I. programs and more. Each program runs in its own isolated environement, eliminating the need for containers. Applications do not need to be installed, they can be run with just a URL.
