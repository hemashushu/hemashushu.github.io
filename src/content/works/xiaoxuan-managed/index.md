_XiaoXuan Managed_ is used for building extreme secure, robust, low-latency and responsive desktop applications, cloud-native applications (such as microservices and serverless functions etc.), business systems, data science programs, A.I. programs and more. Each program runs in its own isolated environement, eliminating the need for containers. Applications do not need to be installed, they can be run with just a URL.

## Motivation

_XiaoXuan Managed_ applications run in an "isolated" environment, which brings a new way to run and publish applications:

**For users**

- You don't have to worry about the source of the application or whether it contains backdoors or malicious code. You can run it with confidence because XiaoXuan Managed applications cannot harm your system or access your private data or files without your permission.

- You can even run a new application without installing it first and use all its features.

**For developers**

- You don't have to open source your work or spend time building user trust. You can simply publish your application when it's ready.

- You don't need to submit your application to an "application store" or wait for lengthy review process.

- You don't have to pay a commission to an "application store".

- You can simply provide users with the application binary package, a URL, or even the address of a Github repository. With this information, users can run your applicaton.

- You can even release new versions of the application at any time, and users will be automatically notified of new versions.

XiaoXuan Managed provides a new "user-application-developer" relationship. Users can simply focus on the features they need, and developer can simply focus on developing their software. There is no "application store" or "maintainer" between the two.

## Features

- **Security**: XiaoXuan Managed applications are sandboxed and cannot access the user's system or data without permission.

- **Portability**: XiaoXuan Managed applications can be run on any platform that supports _XiaoXuan Managed_.

- **Automatic updates**: XiaoXuan Managed applications can be automatically updated to the latest version.
