_XiaoXuan GPU_ is a modern shading language designed to facilitate the rapid development of high-performance programs such as game engines, AR, AI engines, data analysis, biocomputing, scientific computing, and more. It features the same elegant syntax and design philosophy as the _XiaoXuan Lang_, allowing you to develop in new domains without learning a new language.

Under the hood, it compiles to the [WGSL language (WebGPU Shading Language)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/), which can run on the vast majority of GPU platforms and browsers.

## Features

- Modern and expressive syntax

  The _XiaoXuan GPU_ share the same syntax as _XiaoXuan Lang_, which is inspired by JavaScript, Rust and Lisp, making it easy to learn and use for experienced programmers.

- Portable

  _XiaoXuan GPU_ compiles to WGSL, which can run on the vast majority of GPU platforms and browsers.

- Extensible

  _XiaoXuan GPU_ is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to create, share and reuse modules.
