_XiaoYu Micro OS_ is a true operating system (not RTOS) for microcontrollers (MCUs).
Applications (firmware) can be run by simply downloading and configuring, without
the need to install development tools or compilation. Applications even run in a micro container.
It completely changes the way firmware is developed and deployed.
