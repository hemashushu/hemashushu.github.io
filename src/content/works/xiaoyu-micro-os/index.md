_XiaoYu Micro OS_ is a true operating system (not RTOS) for microcontrollers (MCUs).
Applications (firmware) can be run by simply downloading and configuring, without
the need to install cumbersome development tools and debuggers, and compiling from
source code. It completely changes the way firmware is developed and deployed.
