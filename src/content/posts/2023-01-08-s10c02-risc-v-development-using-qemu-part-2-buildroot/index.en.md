<!-- /code_chunk_output -->

In the previous section, we built a minimal Linux system by compiling the _Linux kernel_ and _BusyBox_. While the system contains a base Shell environment and is capable of running static linked user programs, it is not suitable for development purposes. In theory, we could add any software, such as `ssh`, `vim`, `git` or `binutils` and so on by compiling their source codes and copying the binaries and libraries into the image file. Actually, there is a project called [Linux From Scratch](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/) that guides users through building the entire Linux system from source code. Although it's an excellent tutorial for those who want to understand how Linux system are built, it can be challenging for beginners, and the process would be tedious and time consuming.

In this chapter, we will use a tool called [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) to download and compile software automatically, resulting in the creation of an image file. `Buildroot` is free and open-source, so you can check its source code if you want to know how it works.

## 1. Get the _Buildroot_ source code

To get started, create a project folder in your home directory, let's call `riscv64-buildroot`. Once created, change into the folder and clone the [Buildroot source code repository](https://git.buildroot.net/buildroot) via _Git_. After the download is complete, change into the `buildroot` directory and check out a stable version, e.g., `2023.02`:

```bash
$ mkdir ~/riscv64-buildroot
$ cd ~/riscv64-buildroot
$ git clone https://git.buildroot.net/buildroot
$ cd buildroot
$ git checkout -b 2023.02
```

## 2. Configure _Buildroot_

_Buildroot_ is capable of building Linux systems for various hardware platforms. You can check the `board` directory to see a list of all platform vendors and modules. Each platform has one or more corresponding default configurations located in the `configs` directory. Run the following command to configure a QEMU RISC-V target platform with default settings:

```bash
$ make qemu_riscv64_virt_defconfig
```

You can customize the target system by changing the image file capacity, adding packages, and more by execute the `make menuconfig` command:

```bash
$ make menuconfig
```

Check the following options:

```conf
Toolchain --->
    * Install glibc utilities
    * Enable C++ support
Build options --->
    * Enable compiler cache
Filesystem images --->
    * ext2/3/4
        * ext4
    exact size
        * 2048M
```

Where the `image size` option requires manual input.

## 3. Select packages

Next, select the packages you need. Note that the option "Show packages that are also provided by busybox" must be selected first, otherwise some options will be unavailable. You can press the `/` key at any time to search for packages by name. The following is a list of recommended packages for building a RISC-V assembly development environment.

```conf
Target packages --->
    * Show packages that are also provided by busybox
    Compressors and decompressors --->
        * bzip2
        * gzip
        * unzip
        * xz-utils
        * zip
        * zstd
    Debugging, profiling and benchmark --->
        * gdb
            * gdbserver
            * full debugger
            * TUI support
    Development tools --->
        * binutils
            * binutils binaries
        * check
        * diffutils
        * findutils
        * flex
        * gawk
        * gettext
        * git
        * grep
        * libtool
        * make
        * patch
        * pkgconf
        * sed
        * tree
    Hardware handling --->
        * kbd
    Interpreter languages and scripting --->
        * python3
            python3 module format to install --->
                * .py sources and .pyc compiled
            External python modules
                * python-pip
    Libraries --->
        Crypto --->
            * CA Certificates
            openssl support
                ssl library --->
                    * openssl
                openssl
                    * openssl binary
    Networking applications --->
        iputils
            * ping
        * openssh
        * wget
    Shell and utilities --->
        * bash
        * bash completion
        * file
        * sudo
        * time
        * which
    System tools
        * coreutils
            * Individual binaries
        * htop
        * shadow
        * tar
    Text editors and viewers --->
        * less
        * vim
        * install runtime
```

Check out the [Linux From Scratch Book](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/) for a detailed explanation of each package. Once you have selected your packages, select "Save" and "Exit" to exit the configuration interface.

## 4. Compile _Buildroot_

Run the `make` command to start the package download and compilation process.

```bash
$ make -j $(nproc)
```

> The `$(nproc)` is a _command substitution_ that is replaced by the output of the `nproc` command. The `nproc` command is used to display the number of CPU cores. So the above command will become `make -j 6` assuming there are 6 cores in your CPU. This will make the compilation process much faster since the code will be compiled with multiple threads.

Depending on the performance of your machine, you may have time for a cup of tea or perhaps another biscuit while the download and compilation are completed. Afterward, the resulting files will be located in the `output/images` directory. Checking with the `ls` command:

```bash
$ ls -lh output/images
```

The output will resemble the following:

```text
total 252M
-rw-r--r-- 1 yang yang 119K Mar  4 02:58 fw_dynamic.bin
-rw-r--r-- 1 yang yang 1.1M Mar  4 02:58 fw_dynamic.elf
-rw-r--r-- 1 yang yang 119K Mar  4 02:58 fw_jump.bin
-rw-r--r-- 1 yang yang 1.1M Mar  4 02:58 fw_jump.elf
-rw-r--r-- 1 yang yang  19M Mar  4 02:59 Image
-rw-r--r-- 1 yang yang 2.0G Mar  4 03:01 rootfs.ext2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 yang yang   11 Mar  4 02:59 rootfs.ext4 -> rootfs.ext2
-rw-r--r-- 1 yang yang  86M Mar  4 02:59 rootfs.tar
-rwxr-xr-x 1 yang yang  499 Mar  4 02:59 start-qemu.sh
```

## 5. Boot the system

To boot the target system, use the following command:

```bash
qemu-system-riscv64 \
    -machine virt \
    -m 1G \
    -bios ./buildroot/output/images/fw_jump.elf \
    -kernel ./buildroot/output/images/Image \
    -append "rootwait root=/dev/vda ro" \
    -drive file=./buildroot/output/images/rootfs.ext2,format=raw,id=hd0 \
    -device virtio-blk-device,drive=hd0 \
    -netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22 \
    -device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0 \
    -nographic
```

Compare to the previous chapter, there are three new QEMU parameters:

- `-bios ./buildroot/output/images/fw_jump.elf`: This specifies the BIOS firmware. The `fw_jump.elf` is actually the OpenSBI, which is generated by _Buildroot_. Note that when omitting the `-bios` parameter, the QEMU builtin one will be loaded. In this case, we should use the _Buildroot_ version.
- `-netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22` and `-device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0`: These parameters are used to assign a virtual network interface to the virtual machine, and `hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22` means redirect TCP port 10022 from host to port 22 of the virtual machine.

> The _virtual machine_ created by QEMU is also called the _guest machine_, the name it is related to the _host machine_, which is the machine running QEMU.

Once the command is executed, many message will be shown, generated by _OpenSBI_, kernel and the `init` process. You can safely ignore them if there is no error message.

The message will be ended with two lines: `Welcome to Buildroot` and `buildroot login`, enter the user name `root` without password to log in.

```bash
buildroot login: root
```

## 6. Check the system

You can do a quick check to validate whether the cpu module, memory size, kernel version and storage space match what you configured:

```bash
# uname -a
Linux buildroot 5.15.43 #1 SMP Tue Mar 4 07:31:21 CST 2023 riscv64 GNU/Linux

# free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:         988.5M       19.4M      961.0M       48.0K        8.0M      959.1M
Swap:             0           0           0

# df -h

mmu             : sv48
```

![Buildroot](./images/buildroot.png)

Next, check the installed packages:

```bash
# python --version
Python 3.11.2

# git --version
git version 2.40.0

# wget --version | head -n 1
GNU Wget 1.21.3 built on linux-gnu.

# vim --version | head -n 1
VIM - Vi IMproved 9.0 (2022 Jun 28, compiled Mar 12 2023 17:15:56)
```

Note the output text may be slighty different from your guest machine.

## 7. Create a non-privileged user

It's easy to make mistakes when operating with the root user, so it's good practice to creat a non-privileged user after system is installed, and switch to it as soon as possible.

To begin, create a user named `yang` (or the username you usually use) and set its password:

```bash
$ useradd -m -s /bin/bash yang
$ passwd yang
```

Next, add the user to the `sudo` group, which makes it possible to promote privileges when needed.

```bash
$ usermod -a -G sudo yang
```

> Make sure the `shadow` package is selected in _Buildroot_ package selecting step, as the `useradd` and `usermod` commands are provided by this package.

Switch to the newly created user and check its privileges.

```bash
$ su - yang
$ id
uid=1000(yang) gid=1000(yang) groups=1000(yang),102(sudo)
```

The above text `102(sudo)` indicates this account has been successfully added to the `sudo` group. Try running the following command:

```bash
$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers
```

It should not produce any errors.

Create a file `.bash_profile` in the home directory and add the following text to it to improve your experience:

```conf
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
PS1='[\u@\h \W]\$ '
```

Run the command `$ source ~/.bash_profile` to make it take effect. Your custom base Linux system is now fully set up.

## 8. Log in to the guest machine via SSH

Since there may be some minor text rendering defects in the QEMU terminal, it's better to access the guest machine via SSH. Make sure that the `openssh` package is selected in the _Buildroot_ package selecting step, the SSH daemon (a background process) will start automatically. Open another Terminal window and run the following command:

```bash
$ ssh -p 10022 yang@localhost
```

## 9. RISC-V Assembly development

The GNU Assembler and Linker are included in the `binutils` package. You can write some assembly code and assemble it into an executable program file to run it in the guest machine.

To do this, create a file named `hello.S` in the home directory, and add the following text:

```S
    .text
    .global _start

_start:
    # calling convention
    # a0-a2                     - parameters to Linux function
    # a7                        - Linux function number

    # call `write(int fd, char* s, int len)`
    li      a0, 1               # file descriptor, 1 = stdout
    la      a1, s               # the address/pointer to `s` string
                                # `la a1, s` is equivalent to
                                # `lui a1, %hi(s)` and `addi a1, a1, %lo(s)`
    li      a2, 13              # the length of string `s`
    li      a7, 64              # the number of syscall `write`
    ecall

    # call `exit(int)`
    addi    a0, x0, 0           # return code must be from 0 to 255
    addi    a7, x0, 93          # the number of syscall `exit`
    ecall

    .section .rodata
s:
    .asciz  "Hello World!\n"
```

> If you are interested in the RISC-V assembly language, check out another series of my articles: [Gentle RISC-V Assembly Language Tutorial](../).

Next, assemble and link the file:

```bash
$ as -g -o hello.o hello.S
$ ld -o hello.elf hello.o
```

This will generate a file named `hello.elf`. Try running it, a line of text reading "Hello World!" will be displayed if there are no exceptions.

```bash
$ ./hello.elf
Hello World!
```

![Hello World](./images/hello-world.png)

## 10. Debug program by GDB

The `gdb` package has also been installed. Let's start debugging `main.elf`:

```bash
$ gdb hello.elf
```

and run some GDB commands:

```gdb
(gdb) starti
Starting program: /home/yang/hello.elf

Program stopped.
_start () at hello.S:10
10          li      a0, 1               # file descriptor, 1 = stdout
(gdb) x/6i $pc
=> 0x100b0 <_start>:    li      a0,1
   0x100b4 <_start+4>:  auipc   a1,0x0
   0x100b8 <_start+8>:  addi    a1,a1,32
   0x100bc <_start+12>: li      a2,13
   0x100c0 <_start+16>: li      a7,64
   0x100c4 <_start+20>: ecall
(gdb) si
11          la      a1, s               # the address/pointer to `s` string
(gdb) si
0x00000000000100b8      11          la      a1, s               # the address/pointer to `s` string
(gdb) si
14          li      a2, 13              # the length of string `s`
(gdb) si
15          li      a7, 64              # the number of syscall `write`
(gdb) si
16          ecall
(gdb) i r a0 a1 a2 a7
a0             0x1      1
a1             0x100d4  65748
a2             0xd      13
a7             0x40     64
(gdb) q
A debugging session is active.

        Inferior 1 [process 165] will be killed.

Quit anyway? (y or n) y
```

As shown above, this Linux system already contains common tools and is capable of base assembly development and program debugging.

## 11. Where is the GCC toolchain?

Unfortunately, the `gcc` package is not available in Buildroot, as explained in [the Buildroot documentation](https://buildroot.org/downloads/manual/manual.html#faq-no-compiler-on-target). If you have patient enough, you can compile the GCC toolchains from source and copy it into the guest machine, It may be helpful to check out some scripts such as [musl-riscv-toolchain](https://github.com/michaeljclark/musl-riscv-toolchain/) and [musl-cross-make](https://git.zv.io/toolchains/musl-cross-make).

Alternatively, you can download the pre-compiled RISC-V crossing compilation toolchains from [toolchains.bootlin.com](https://toolchains.bootlin.com/) and the native compilation toolchains from [musl.cc](https://musl.cc/). But these are beyond the scope of this chapter.

## 12. Conclusion

In this section, we built a base Linux system that contains general tools as well as `binutils` and `gdb` using _Buildroot_. However, it is still not complete, for example, the GCC toolchain is missing, and there is no package management tool, making it difficult to install or update software.

In the next section, we will set up a complete Debian distribution in QEMU.
