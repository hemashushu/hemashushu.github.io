## Q & A

### What do the names _XiaoXuan_ and _XiaoYu_ mean?

They don't have any special meaning, they just sound similar to my children's nicknames.

### Why are there so many "childlike" illustrations on this website?

I originally wanted to create a simple programming language for my kids. They
loved watching me draw simple illustrations, so I added these illustrations to the documentation (web pages) in the hope of attracting their interest.

### Why do some projects only have documentation but no released code or binary packages?

Developing a programming language is a huge undertaking, so many projects are still in heavy development. This means that they are currently just a collection of scattered code, and while they can implement basic functions, they are not ready for release, I will release them when they are ready.

For now, only _XiaoXuan Core_ is complete, you can download it and try it out. I will then release _XiaoXuan Script_, _XiaoXuan Native_, _XiaoXuan Managed_ and other projects.

### Why use the MPL open source license and additional terms instead of other permissive licenses?

Because I am a nobody, I don't want someone or a company to take my work and turn it into their "product". You know, not eveyone respects other people's effort.

### Are all these projects your personal work?

Yes. And most of my work doesn't have "clients", which means that on one pays me and there is no project funding. I would greatly appreciate it if you could sponsor me!

### What is your motivation?

My goal is to be able to build a completely new computer system that I like all by myself, including hardware, instruction set, programming language, operating system, and applications. This is my greatest pleasure. At the same time, I will share my building process and results, hoping to help others.
